      <p>
      I am a Boston-based web developer with a passion for technology and entertainment. I first started playing Magic when I was young and got my hands on a Mirrodin (I think?) starter deck. I didn&#39;t know how to play, but I enjoyed looking at the cards and putting them in imaginary situations. Now I play Commander/EDH regularly with my friends. I am a huge fan of green. The decks I currently have are <a href='#/card/36d4574a-3266-4497-b145-fb25820d8a7f'>Goreclaw, Terror of Qal Sisma</a>; <a href='#/card/d85783d6-bbaf-4720-8151-5083de1e9f55'>Roalesk, Apex Hybrid</a>; <a href='#/card/623ec8c3-9173-4dc8-bd93-0b22d852fa60'>Reki, the History of Kamigawa</a>; and <a href='#/card/dd1e21f6-2314-469e-b80e-8678c960c09e'>Gishath, Sun&#39;s Avatar</a>.

      I had been thinking of a quarantine project to sink my teeth into for a while and ended up landing on this idea. I love looking at stats, and knew that this project would take a lot of time and learning. I&#39;m hoping to run into issues that will make me a more versatile developer, of which there have aleady been a few.
